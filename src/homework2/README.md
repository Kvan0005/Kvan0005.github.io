This is the HomeWork 2 of the course Computational Geometry.

- [x] Implement your favorite convex hull algorithm. then clicks on a button to display the convex hull.
- [x] Implement a generic BinarySearch(a,b,f) function that takes as input a function $f(i)$ that returns True or False, and the range of integers $[a,b]$  to search. It returns a value $i \in [a,b]$ such that $f(i)$ is True and ($f(i+1)$ is False or $i=b$).
- [x] Implement an algorithm that checks if a point $q$ is inside a convex polygon $P$ (the convex hull of the previous exercise: once the convex hull has been computed, clicking on any point displays the word "INSIDE" or "OUTSIDE"),
- [ ] If the point is outside, compute and display the two tangents to $P$ through $q$.
