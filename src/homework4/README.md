This is the HomeWork 4 of the course Computational Geometry.

Let the user draw a set of lines. The program should highlight (in a different color) the cell (= the face of the arrangement) that contains point (0,0). This can be done using the polar dual (a,b)â†”ax+by=1

.

The convex hull of the dual points corresponds to the structure of the cell: each edge of the convex hull of the dual points corresponds to a vertex of the cell. Look at what happens when the cell is unbounded!
