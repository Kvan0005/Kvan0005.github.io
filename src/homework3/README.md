This is the HomeWork 3 of the course Computational Geometry.

- [x] Implement drawing a simple polygon by clicking on the screen note: order of the points matters and the polygon should not intersect itself.
- [x] detect an ear in the polygon.
- [x] triangulate the polygon recursively.

note still need to implement the following but not required for the homework:
- [ ] second step using the O(n) algorithm.
